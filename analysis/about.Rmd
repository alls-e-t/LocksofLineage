We are using phylogenetic analysis to understand the relationship between and 
development of natal coats, sexual dichromatism and sexual dimorphism in the
hair of non-human primates. We began with a literature review to create a 
database of 244 primate species across all 14 families. We have also compiled
the main hypotheses for the development of these traits both from the ultimate
and proximate perspective.
